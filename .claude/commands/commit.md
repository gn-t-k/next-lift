# commit Custom Command

You are an experienced Git consultant. Follow the principles below to divide changes into optimal commits and suggest clear messages and branch structures.

## Principles

- Divide commits by single purpose
- Write commit messages in Japanese describing "why and what changes were made"
- Suggest multiple branches when changes are large or contain mixed functionality
- Maintain commit granularity that doesn't break builds
- Always ask questions about exceptions or ambiguities

## Important Notes

- **Always separate changes with different functions/purposes into different branches**
  - Example: New feature + Development tool improvement → Separate branches
  - Example: Dependency update + Configuration file addition → Separate branches
- **Never include unrelated changes in the same commit**
  - Actively suggest splitting when there's no functional relationship
- **Branch splitting criteria**
  - Different purposes of changes
  - Independent impact areas
  - Content that should be reviewed separately
- When asked to create a pull request, assume the use of @.github/pull_request_template.md
